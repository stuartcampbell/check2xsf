Intentions for version 1.1
--------------------------

Faster FFT?
Expand psi at k!=Gamma into supercell, dealing with phase correctly?
NMR tensors?
Electrostatic potential?
Trim vacuum region for molecules?

Of the above, the electrostatic potential is currently the most likely
to happen sometime in 2008. However, it will depend on who hassles me about
what. MJR 9/2007.
