Changes in 1.0
--------------

None! (Save version in c2xsf.h)

Changes in 1.0RC6
-----------------

-x= and -X= options added (I must stop adding features to RCs!)
-t= and -T= options added (I must stop adding features to RCs!)
Some output which used to appear at -vv moved to -vvv
super() no longer forces axes to a right hand set
super() sorts atoms, by atomic number, c, b, a, if compiled -DQSORT
NULL output format introduced
-H added, and x<->z inversion problem in xplor output solved
Released under GPL v2

Changes in 1.0RC5
-----------------

-m rewritten to cope with odd FFT grids, and to shift each axis independently
-m=a,b,c introduced
-vv lists bands indexed from 1 to nbands, not 0 to (nbands-1)
-vv gives more precision for band evalues

Changes in 1.0RC4
-----------------

CML introduced
PDBN introduced
--help recognised (as synonym for -h)
All references to version number moved to c2xsf.h

Changes in 1.0RC3
-----------------

Aborts cleanly if .cube output requested and no 3D data present
Can now read .cell files with DOS line endings
PDB files are now written with atom numbers starting from one, not zero.

Changes in 1.0RC2
-----------------

.cell parsing improved marginally
Serious bug concerning reading atomic symbols correctly from v4 .check
  files squashed
-V flag (print version and exit) added

Introduced at 1.0RC1
--------------------

New FFT (should not be user-visible...)
Different default scaling of psi
Option to avoid scaling densities and psis
Printing the integral of densities with -vv
