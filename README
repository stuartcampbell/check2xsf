Check2xsf
---------

This program should convert CASTEP's .check, .castep_bin and .cell to various
other formats, particularly so that they can be visualised with Jmol
(http://www.jmol.org) or XCrysDen (http://www.xcrysden.org). Examples
of check2xsf's use can be found at http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~mjr/vis/
and further documentation is in the included man page (check2xsf.1).

The code can also manipulate .cell and .pdb files, building supercells
or performing shifts.

The code is released under version 2 of the GPL, a copy of which
should be in the accompanying "LICENCE" file. There is no warrenty or
statement that the code is fit for anything. The author is unware that
any person or organisation other than himself has any claim on any IPR
in the code.

The code should build easily if one sets CFLAGS and CC in the Makefile
correctly.
