With luck, this should build with any reasonable ANSI C89 compiler.
Edit the Makefile to suit, type "make", and copy the resulting
check2xsf wherever you like. The man page is check2xsf.1.

One warning about pointers may be produced by check_read.c -- it is not
a major problem. Honest.

[Details: IEEE floating point storage, with 8 byte doubles, is assumed.
          Both big and little endian machines should work fine.]
